PLAY

Anyone begins. Play proceeds to the left.
On your turn you must announce your action FIRST: FIGHT, TRAIN, HEAL, or LEVEL.

IF YOU DRAW A CARD WITHOUT FIRST SAYING YOUR ACTION, DISCARD IT AND FORFEIT YOUR TURN.

FIGHT
Draw a card from the Deck
Fight the Numbered card (Or see "SPECIALS")
Fight RED cards with RA, BLACK cards with BA
If you have more Attack than the value on the Numbered card, you capture the Monster
Keep the card as one Monster Point (1MP)
If you tie, check your Luck. LP >= the card value wins
Lost fights cause 1 damage

TRAIN
Draw a card from the deck
Numbered cards MUST replace one of your Attributes (Or see "SPECIALS")

HEAL
Heal 1HP

LEVEL
Discard 5MP from your captured Monsters, and add one Attribute to your character (Max L8).
Draw until you reach a Numbered card. Discard any Specials.

SPECIALS
