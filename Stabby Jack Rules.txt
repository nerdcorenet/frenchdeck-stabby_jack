Stabby Jack is a Role-Playing Game (RPG) played with a deck of cards.

2+ players use one deck of 52/54 cards per two players: 2 decks for 3-4P, etc.
A marker to indicate Damage is also required.

Players win by increasing their character's Attributes, Leveling Up, and fighting Monsters!

-- SETUP --

2-10 are Numbered cards.
Ace(A), Jack(J), Queen(Q), King(K), and Joker(O) are Specials.
Jokers are optional.

Shuffle the cards and place them face down in the middle of the table.
This is the Deck. There will also be a Discard pile.
When the Deck is emptied, leave the top Discard on the table and reshuffle the Deck.

Each player requires a space for their character's Attributes, captured Monsters, and a means to track Damage.

-- CHARACTERS --

Deal each player four Numbered cards (2-10) face up. Discard any Specials.
These are each character's Attributes.
Characters are born with Numbered cards equal to their Level(L). Begin at L4. Maximum is L8.

(H) Hearts   =       Health (HP)
(C) Clubs    =         Luck (LP)
(S) Spades   = Black Attack (BA)
(D) Diamonds =   Red Attack (RA)

Suits stack together EX: 3H,8H,4C,5C,4S = 11HP,9LP,4BA

A player with no Hearts has a character with 1HP.

-- PLAY --

Anyone begins. Play proceeds to the left in turns...

On your turn you must announce your action first: You may Fight, Train, Stay In Bed, or Level Up.

IF YOU DRAW A CARD WITHOUT SAYING WHAT YOUR ACTION IS, DISCARD IT AND FORFEIT YOUR TURN.

IF YOU DRAW A SPECIAL CARD, A SPECIAL EVENT HAPPENS (SEE BELOW).

"Fight"
Draw a card from the Deck.
Fight the Numbered card (2-10),
- Fight RED cards with Diamonds(D)
- Fight BLACK cards with Spades(S)
If you have more Attack than the value on the Numbered card, you capture the monster: Keep the card as one Monster Point (+1MP).
If you lose, mark 1 Damage (-1HP).
If you tie, check your Luck. LP >= the card value wins the fight.

"Train"
Draw a card from the deck.
This Numbered card (2-10) replaces any one of your Attributes (you choose).

"Stay In Bed"
Heal 1HP / Remove one Damage

"Level Up"
Discard 5MP from your captured Monsters, and add one Attribute to your character (Max L8).
Draw until you reach a Numbered card. Discard any Specials.

-- SPECIALS --

A, J, Q, K, O are Special cards.

Any time a Special card is drawn, its Special Event happens and the turn ends.
The two exceptions to this are Birth and Level Up from MP, when Specials are Discarded.

The card may be of the same Number or of the same Suit.

1. Receive a blessing:
  Heal 2HP / -2 Damage, or
2. Steal from the Queen:

-- DEATH --

If a character's Damage exceeds the sum of their Heart Attribute cards (0HP), the character dies.

The player may immediately be dealt a new character at the same Level as the one who died. Deal new Numbered cards, Discard all Specials.
A character may or may not die on their turn. Play continues to the left.

1. Ten or more Monster Points (10MP),
2. More Luck (LP) than each other character, and
3. Enough attack power (BA or RA) to reduce each other character's Health (HP) to zero.

-- REMINDERS --
